    <h3>Coding (Rec Room)</h3>
    <p>I'm mostly an AI expert; I've spent 2 years learning AI movement and pathfinding. 
        I've made a basic physics system, made lifelike movement, and animal hunting patterns.</p><br>
       
        <h3>Coding Backstory</h3>
       <p> I've always been into technology, but the easy coding systems of rec room and scratch pushed me into wanting to code.
        I've also played a lot of games while growing up, so being able to create one myself seemed like a good idea, and a fun one too.
        I decided to start learning more popular languages, and that's how I came up with this website.
        This website is a composite of what I've learned over the course of late 2024 to 2025.
        I'll also be selling courses on stuff that I've learned in an easy way to understand, I'll be giving coherent tutorials in the courses to 
        get you guys a better start if you want a clear guide on how to code.</p>
